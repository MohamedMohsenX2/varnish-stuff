Some of the many people to thank:

* Poul-Henning Kamp, for showing me countless smart tricks to employ, and
  also a little bit for writing Varnish Cache.
* Martin Blix Grydeland, for the original varnish-agent and words of wisdom
  when it comes to varnishapi usage.
* Tollef Fog Heen, for poking automake-stuff and jenkins and whatnot until
  things worked.
* Lasse Karstensen, for early testing and bug reports.
* Yves Hwang/Per Buer, for testing on Mac OS X. Not sure you actually
  deserve a thanks for that though... !@#!@# mac.
