About the material
==================

This book is part of Varnish Software's
(http://www.varnish-software.com) official training material.

The material is primarily written to be used in a classroom context. In
the classroom, each sub-chapter is a slide and the participants gets a
printed version with extra information. The documentation you are reading
will reflect that structure.

The training material evolves constantly. Some chapters are more evolved
than others, which a course instructor usually compensates for by live
demonstrations or more in-depth discussion.

All the VCL code examples are verified for syntax-correctness frequently
(semi-automatically). This does not, however, guarantee that they do what
they are supposed to do, only that it is correct VCL syntax.
